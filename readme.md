The new version of Martabak is implementing [Janggelan PHP Framework](https://www.github.com/dalikewara/janggelan), [Petis JavaScript Library](https://www.github.com/dalikewara/petis), and [Lodeh CSS Style-Source](https://www.github.com/dalikewara/lodeh).

*It's so funny while we developing this repository. Because, sometimes we were found bugs and errors in our other tools like Janggelan, Petis, and Lodeh that are related with this repository. So, we could sent them with new commits directly to our GitHub/Bitbucket account.*
